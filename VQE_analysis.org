* Introduction

Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)[fn:1] is a hybrid quantum-classical
algorithm that can be used on NISQ devices to find the ground states of various
quantum mechanical systems, most notably used in quantum chemistry[fn:2] and
nuclear physics[fn:3]. Here we will see a demonstration of the variational
quantum eigensolver with the Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
H = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\
  0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{align}
whose eigenvalues can be calculated easily on a classical computer:

#+begin_src jupyter-python
import numpy as np

H = np.zeros(shape=(4, 4))
H[0, 0] = H[3, 3] = 1
H[1, 2] = H[2, 1] = -1

print("Hamiltonian:")
print(H)

print(f"Eigenvalues: {np.linalg.eigvals(H)}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hamiltonian:
: [[ 1.  0.  0.  0.]
:  [ 0.  0. -1.  0.]
:  [ 0. -1.  0.  0.]
:  [ 0.  0.  0.  1.]]
: Eigenvalues: [ 1. -1.  1.  1.]

The minimum eigenvalue is \(-1\). While the eigenvalues for this Hamiltonian could
be calculated easily on a classical computer, this is not generally true for
Hamiltonians of interest in physics and chemistry. Hence the need for algorithms
like VQE.

* Algorithm

The VQE algorithm can be broken down in to the following steps:

1. Design a quantum circuit, controlled by a set of parameters
   \({θ_i}\), and prepare the initial state \(|ψ^0〉\) with this circuit. This
   is known as the ansatz.

2. Define the objective function \(f({θ_i^n}) =
   ⟨ψ({θ_i^n})|H|ψ({θ_i^n})⟩\), that is the expectation value of the
   Hamiltonian with respect the ansatz.

3. Let \(n = 0\).

4. Repeat until optimization is completed:
   a. Calculate \(f({θ_i^n})\) on the quantum computer.
   b. Feed \(f({θ_i^n})\) to a classical minimization algorithm, and allow it
      to determine \({θ_i^{n+1}}\).

* Ansatz

There are two things that the user can choose in this algorithm: the initial
state, and the classical minimization algorithm. Of this, it turns out, the
initial state (ansatz) is the most important. The selection of a particular
ansatz are usually determined by the choice of the hardware, and the features of
the problem, such as the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. For computation on NISQ
devices, the hardware is usually the dominating factor. We will consider two
ansatzes for this demonstration. The first is parameterized by RY and RZ
gates. This is a special case of the hardware efficient ansatz described in the
paper by Kandala /et al./.

#+begin_src jupyter-python :results silent
from vqe.vqe import RYRZAnsatz, RXAnsatz
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))
RYRZAnsatz(reps=3, barriers=True).draw("mpl", ax=ax)
fig.suptitle("RYRZ ansatz with 3 repetitions")
fig.savefig("img/ryrz_ansatz.png", dpi=90, bbox_inches="tight")
plt.close()
#+end_src

[[file:img/ryrz_ansatz.png]]

The second ansatz is parameterized by RX gates.

#+begin_src jupyter-python :results silent
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))
RXAnsatz(reps=3, barriers=True).draw("mpl", ax=ax)
fig.suptitle("RX ansatz with 3 repetitions")
fig.savefig("img/rx_ansatz.png", dpi=90, bbox_inches="tight")
plt.close()
#+end_src

[[file:img/rx_ansatz.png]]

These were the multi-layer versions of the ansatzes. In the single-layer
versions the blocks just appear once.

* Pauli Decomposition

One caveat of using VQE is that in general it is not easy to calculate the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian. However if the Hamiltonian can be
expressed as a linear sum of tensor products of the Pauli matrices \((I, X, Y,
Z)\), then we can easily calculate the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian. Tensor products of Pauli matrices, \(\{\{I, X, Y, Z\}^{⊗n}\}\),
form an orthogonal basis for the vector space of \(2^n × 2^n\) Hermitian
matrices. Thus any \(2^n × 2^n\) Hermitian matrix can be expressed as a linear
sum of tensor products of Pauli matrices. For example, for n = 1, consider the
Hermitian matrix
\begin{align}
A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & -3 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
This matrix can be expressed as \(A = -\tfrac{1}{2}I + X + \tfrac{5}{2}Z\). In
general for a \(2^n × 2^n\) Hermitian matrix A, the coefficients of expansion in
the basis of tensor products of Pauli matrices is given by
\begin{align}
a_{i_1 i_2 ⋯ i_n}
= \frac{1}{2^n} \mathrm{tr}((σ_{i_1} ⊗ σ_{i_2} ⊗ ⋯ σ_{i_n})A),
\end{align}
where \(σ_{i_j} ∈ \{I, X, Y, Z\}\). The factor of \(\frac{1}{2^n}\) is to normalize
the Pauli matrices. The function =pauli_decomposition= in
=vqe/utils.py= does this decomposition for any \(2^n × 2^n\) Hermitian
matrix. Here is the decomposition of our Hamiltonian \(H\):

#+begin_src jupyter-python
from vqe.utils import pauli_decomposition

pauli_decomposition(H)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: defaultdict(int, {'II': 0.5, 'XX': -0.5, 'YY': -0.5, 'ZZ': 0.5})

We can express our Hamiltonian as \(H = \tfrac{1}{2}(II + ZZ - XX - YY)\). Thus
\(〈H〉 = \tfrac{1}{2}(〈II〉 + 〈ZZ〉 - 〈XX〉 - 〈YY〉)\), where \(〈O〉 =
〈ψ|O|ψ〉\) is the expectation value of the observable \(O\). Since the
expectation value of \(II\) is always \(1\), therefore this boils down to
calculating the expectation values of \(ZZ\), \(XX\), and \(YY\), and then doing
the weighted sum of all the four expectation values. Tensor products of Pauli
matrices have only two eigenvalues, \(±1\). The expectation value of a tensor
product of Pauli matrices can be calculated on a quantum computer as
\(\tfrac{(N_+ - N_-)}{N}\), where \(N_±\) is the number of measured eigenvectors
corresponding to the eigenvalue \(±1\) and \(N\) is the total number of
measurements[fn:4]. The function =energy= in =vqe/vqe.py= computes the
expectation value of any Hamiltonian which has a Pauli decomposition with
respect to any given ansatz.

* Optimization

Any classical optimization algorithm can be used in VQE, with varying degrees of
success. Gradient-free methods like COBYLA, Nelson-Mead, SPSA etc. are the
preferred methods for these problems since it will be difficult to calculate the
derivative of the objective function. For problems like VQE, SPSA or
Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Algorithm[fn:5] might be the most suitable, since
it scales well to large problems (unlike COBYLA), and accounts for noise which
is ubiquitous on a NISQ device. SPSA is implemented in =vqe/optimizers.py=.

* Simulation

We will do these simulations with the =qasm_simulator= backend provided by
Qiskit, initially without noise. First we will demonstrate VQE with the single
layer RYRZ ansatz, and then with the single layer RX ansatz.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
from vqe.vqe import energy
from vqe.optimizers import SPSA


# The expectation value of the Hamiltonian
def parameterized_energy(params, H, ansatz, **kwargs):
    return energy(H, ansatz, params=params, **kwargs)


# Random number generator
seed = 42
rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)

# Optimizer
maxiter = 1000
save_steps = 50
a = 2 * np.pi * 0.1
c = 0.1
A = 0.0001
spsa = SPSA(a=a, c=c, A=A)

# VQE with RYRZ ansatz
reps = 1
thetas_yz = rng.uniform(0, 2 * np.pi, size=(4 * (reps + 1)))
ryrz_ansatz = RYRZAnsatz(reps=reps)

result_yz = spsa.minimize(
    parameterized_energy,
    thetas_yz,
    maxiter=maxiter,
    save_steps=save_steps,
    seed=seed,
    H=H,
    ansatz=ryrz_ansatz,
)

print(f"Lowest eigenvalue is {result_yz['fun']:.4f}.")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Lowest eigenvalue is -0.9990.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
# VQE with RX ansatz
reps = 1
thetas_x = rng.uniform(0, 2 * np.pi, size=reps)
rx_ansatz = RXAnsatz(reps=reps)

result_x = spsa.minimize(
    parameterized_energy,
    thetas_x,
    maxiter=maxiter,
    save_steps=save_steps,
    seed=seed,
    H=H,
    ansatz=rx_ansatz,
)

print(f"Lowest eigenvalue is {result_x['fun']:.4f}.")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Lowest eigenvalue is -1.0000.

Both the ansatzes effectively give \(-1\) as the minimum eigenvalue when running
on the simulator without noise. Let us now add noise to the simulation. For this
we will real noise data from the =ibmq_vigo= device using the data stored in
Qiskit Terra.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
from qiskit import Aer
from qiskit.test.mock import FakeVigo
from qiskit.providers.aer.noise import NoiseModel

# Vigo noise model
device_backend = FakeVigo()
coupling_map = device_backend.configuration().coupling_map
noise_model = NoiseModel.from_backend(device_backend)
basis_gates = noise_model.basis_gates

# BasicAer does not support noise, we need the simulator from Aer
backend = Aer.get_backend("qasm_simulator")

# Noisy VQE with RYRZ ansatz
result_yz_noisy = spsa.minimize(
    parameterized_energy,
    thetas_yz,
    maxiter=maxiter,
    save_steps=save_steps,
    seed=seed,
    H=H,
    ansatz=ryrz_ansatz,
    backend=backend,
    noise_model=noise_model,
    coupling_map=coupling_map,
    basis_gates=basis_gates
)

print(f"Lowest eigenvalue is {result_yz_noisy['fun']:.4f}.")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Lowest eigenvalue is -0.8760.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
# Noisy VQE with RX ansatz
result_x_noisy = spsa.minimize(
    parameterized_energy,
    thetas_x,
    maxiter=maxiter,
    save_steps=save_steps,
    seed=seed,
    H=H,
    ansatz=rx_ansatz,
    backend=backend,
    noise_model=noise_model,
    coupling_map=coupling_map,
    basis_gates=basis_gates
)

print(f"Lowest eigenvalue is {result_x_noisy['fun']:.4f}.")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Lowest eigenvalue is -0.8584.

With noise added to the system we no longer get the exact lowest eigenvalue of
the Hamiltonian. But we still come close to it.

* Visualization

We can see the progress of the optimization, which might give us some insights
into VQE.

#+begin_src jupyter-python :results silent
iters = np.arange(0, maxiter + save_steps, save_steps)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))
ax.plot(iters, result_yz["log"]["fevals"], color="darkorange", linestyle="solid", label="RYRZ (noiseless)")
ax.plot(iters, result_yz_noisy["log"]["fevals"], color="darkorange", linestyle="dashed", label="RYRZ (noisy)")
ax.plot(iters, result_x["log"]["fevals"], color="dodgerblue", linestyle="solid", label="RX (noiseless)")
ax.plot(iters, result_x_noisy["log"]["fevals"], color="dodgerblue", linestyle="dashed", label="RX (noisy)")
ax.set_xlabel("Iterations")
ax.set_ylabel("Energy")
ax.legend()
fig.savefig("img/rx_log.png", bbox_inches="tight", dpi=90)
plt.close()
#+end_src

[[file:img/rx_log.png]]

Few observations that we can immediately make from this figure:
1. VQE converges pretty fast for the RX ansatz, both with and without
   noise. About 200 SPSA iterations seem to be enough, instead of the 1000 that
   we used.
2. Surprisingly noisy RYRZ converges faster, albeit to a wrong value, than the
   noiseless version. This could be due to the probabilistic nature of SPSA. In
   general the RYRZ ansatz takes more time than the RX ansatz to converge. This
   shows the impact of the choice of the ansatz.
3. The effect of the noise is fairly constant, more so for the RX ansatz, than
   the RYRZ ansatz. The noise pretty much just shifts the converged results by a
   constant amount. If we know that what the effect of the noise is going to be
   then we might be able to correct for it.

* Conclusion

We demonstrated the VQE algorithm with a quantum simulator. We showed that it
gives the lowest eigenvalue on a noiseless device. On a noisy device, it does
not give the correct answer, but it goes quite close. Maybe further error
correction procedures can help with that.

Further explorations would naturally involve trying out other ansatz, and other
optimization methods. Automatic differentiation would greatly facilitate the use
of gradient based optimizers for VQE problems. Though SPSA did an excellent job
with this toy problem, it would be worthwhile to check if gradient based
optimizers give superior performance. Towards that end one could investigate how
to integrate existing automatic differentiation packages like JAX and Autograd
with quantum computing packages like Qiskit. The most important exploration
would be to try this on an actual quantum computer, with a more complicated
Hamiltonian to demonstrate the quantum advantage that VQE provides.

The code for this is in the =vqe= folder. Please check that for details
regarding my implementation of the various parts of the VQE algorithm.
